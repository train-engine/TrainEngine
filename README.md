## Prerequisites

### Toolchain

- GCC or Clang
    > Note: For Windows, make sure you have MinGW-w64 SEH 6.1.0 64-bit installed and in your PATH. This version is important since SFML's binaries are shipped with the engine. If you want to use a different compiler, you must recompile SFML 2.4.2 and replace it in the engine under [`libs/SFML-2.4.2`](libs/SFML-2.4.2).
- Make
    > Note: For Windows, you should use Git Bash (shipped with Git for Windows). Use `mingw32-make` instead of `make`.
- clang-format
- clang-tidy
- Doxygen and Graphviz

### Dependencies

- SFML 2.4.2 or 2.5.1
    - Linux: Install SFML using your system's package manager. For example: `sudo apt install libsfml-dev`
    - macOS: Install SFML using the [instructions here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.6/start-osx.php#installing-sfml).
    - Windows: Windows will use the vendored SFML library under [`libs/SFML-2.4.2`](libs/SFML-2.4.2).
